# Getting started

Read the following [tutorial](https://developer.android.com/training/basics/firstapp/index.html).
Build the simple app that's described there. In the process you will also install Android Studio and will setup a development environment. Make a dedicated directory on your hard drive where you will put all the projects you create (E.g. `C:\Projects\` or `~/Projects/`).

Start reading about __activities__ [here](https://developer.android.com/guide/components/activities/index.html).
Roughly speaking activities represent a screen in the app.

While reading the [introduction](https://developer.android.com/guide/components/activities/intro-activities.html) override the following methods in an activity in the app you've already built: 
`onCreate(Bundle)`, `onStart`, `onResume`, `onPause`, `onStop`, `onRestart`, `onDestroy`. Add the following code `Log.i("Lifecycle", METHOD_NAME);` in the methods implementation, METHOD_NAME being a string of each method name.

Now open __Logcat__ in Android Studio (lower left corner). It shows you real-time logging. If using a real device you must enable developer options -> usb debugging. Experiment with your app - rotate the device/emulator, minimize the app to recents and maximize it again, lock the device and then unlock it. Notice when each method is called.

Read about the [**activity lifecycle**](https://developer.android.com/guide/components/activities/activity-lifecycle.html) where the workflow of these methods is explained in depth.  


Read about activity [state changes](https://developer.android.com/guide/components/activities/state-changes.html).
